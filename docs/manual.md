### HISTORY

In late 2010, this project was registered on Sourceforge.net. Since November 2011,
documentation is contributed. As December 2011, Customizer development has moved to
GitHub and has been tested thoroughly on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx). One year later, 
as December 2012, Customizer stable release has hit 3.2.3.

Between late-2014 and early-2015, Customizer was rewritten in Python with the goal to 
support Ubuntu releases newer than 12.04 and making it more stable and robust.
